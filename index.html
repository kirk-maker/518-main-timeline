- Days before The Douglass' had a prior sit down with the Chief, Administrator, City Attorney, Mayor, the Chief knew the story very well. Half of what he claims as fact is completely false, its misleading as if the church is bring action against us, not the other way around, he ends comparing it to a weed dispute between neighbors where the complaint was wrong IIRC. Horrible analogy, regardless. This email sets the tone and prejudice I would then see from GPD offers during intereactions throughout this ordeal. That still continues.
