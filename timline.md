You said:
can you pleas shorten the descriptions in many of these entries to simple terms; gumc, city, stauffer, douglass, meeting, dispute, etc. main intent here is public trust, try to be as impartial and objective as possible while still keeping a warm tone
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely. Here’s a clean, impartial, “plain-terms” version. Copy all of this into your timeline.md. It keeps things short and objective (GUMC, City, Stauffer, Douglass, meeting, dispute, etc.), while your Open links remain the same.

Copy everything between the lines into timeline.md
